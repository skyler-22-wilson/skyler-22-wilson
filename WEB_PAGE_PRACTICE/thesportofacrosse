   		>I chose to pursue lacrosse instead of hockey because lacrosse provided a greater opportunity for me to earn an education from a prestigious college than hockey. Also, as someone who has always enjoyed a skill based competitive game, there is no better sport than lacrosse. The division one collegiate level is <em> at least in my oppinion</em> the pinnacle of the sport where I compete for Yale University. I always enjoyed being able to just pick up my stick and grab a ball and find any wall around, rather than purchasing an ice time and putting on all of the heavy hockey gear. Moreover, i generally just found the sport more fun and I excelled at it much more than I did with Hockey. </p>
    
    <h2 id="skills-required"> Skills Needed To Excel in The Sport:</h2>
    
    <!--Skyler's personal opinion and general consensus among other players and coaches-->
    
    	<p class= "how-to-excel-in-lacrosse"> There are many skills needed to excel in the sport of lacrosse, you need to be <em>athletic</em>, have <em>soft</em> hands and a basic knowledge of the how to play. <strong>Many skills from other sports can translate to lacrosse</strong> such as stick handling in hockey and game play in basketball. The hardest part to pick up is the stick skills which take many hours of practice to master. However, wall-ball, passing, and shooting practice help to improve these skills. </p>
